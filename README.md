# CS396 Assignment 6 - Ellie Goldsmith
Goal: The code will produce a  snake with the following:
Random number of randomly shaped links with random sensor placement along the chain. Links with sensors are colored green and links without sensors are colored blue.

In order to determine which links have sensors, every time a link is generated, a random number either 0 or 1 is generated and if the number is 0, the link will have a sensor and if the number is 1, the link will not have a sensor.

Installation: Use the instructions from the first part of r/ludobots to download python3, pip, and other packages needed.

Running the Code: Open the terminal (for Mac users) and go to the directory containing the folder with the code files. Run the code by typing "python3 search.py" into the command window on terminal and the simulation should run with a random snake. Run "python3 search.py" multiple times to see various randomized snakes.
