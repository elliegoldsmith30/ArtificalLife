# CS396 Assignment 5 - Ellie Goldsmith
Goal: The robot's goal is to "kick" the block as far as possible away from the screen. Fitness is measured by the positioning of the block at the end of the simulation.


Installation:
Use the instructions from the first part of r/ludobots to download python3, pip, and other packages needed.

Running the Code:
Open the terminal (for Mac users) and go to the directory containing the folder with the code files. Run the code by typing "python3 search.py" into the command window on terminal and the simulation should run beginning with a random robot showing and then parent and child fitnesses will display and it will end by simulating the best (evolved) robot.
